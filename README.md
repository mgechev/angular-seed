this is only a test fork. Don't expect this to be stable, maintained or anythong else ...

# How to start

```

In order to start the test drive use:


```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed.git
cd angular2-seed
# install the project's dependencies
npm install
# watches your files and uses livereload by default
npm start

npm run build.prod
```
