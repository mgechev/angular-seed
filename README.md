# Introduction

A seed project for AngularJS 2 apps.

It is something similar to the AngularJS Quick Start but does the entire build with gulp.

**Note:** Angular 2.0 is not production ready yet! This seed project is perfect for playing around with the latest versions but do not start new projects with it since a lot of new changes are going to be introduced until the framework is officially released.

# How to start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgechev/angular2-seed.git
cd angular2-seed
npm install
# If you don't have gulp already installed
npm install -g gulp
gulp build.lib.dev
gulp serve.dev
```
